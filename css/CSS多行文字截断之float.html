      <p class="content">President Donald Trump has warned Syria's government the US is "locked and loaded" to strike
        again if it carries out chemical attacks.

        The warning came after the US, UK and France struck three Syrian sites in response to a suspected deadly
        chemical attack in the town of Douma a week ago.

        Syria denies any chemical use and says that attack was fabricated by rebels.

        A UN Security Council vote brought by Syria's ally, Russia, to condemn the US-led strikes was rejected.

        The wave of strikes represents the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by
        Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war.

        While Western powers have supported rebels from early on in the war, they have not intervened against Syria
        directly.</p>
